Detecting Spam messages using NLP techniques in Python


## Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing, more commonly referred to as NLP, can be described in many ways.
In simple terms, it is how a computer deals with text data. This includes how it finds meaningful
information from random text, and how it carries out instructions involving natural languages.

Natural Languages are those languages that have been created naturally for the purpose of
communication between human beings. These include English (eng), Hindi (हिन्दी) and Chinese (中
国), but not languages such as Assembly languages, Python, or Java, which were created for the
purpose of communication between humans and machines.

Computers are amazing at processing numbers and can-do humongous calculations in microseconds,
while they are not that good at processing textual data, which is why they have to be taught to do so
with the aid of Machine Learning Techniques such as NLP.
